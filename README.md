NB: this repository only shows the FRONT-END part of the project, for the back-end code, please go to: https://github.com/thomasaugot/app-partymates-server

I developed this application as my third and last project during a full stack web development program at Ironhack.
The application uses all MERN stack technologies:
- Front-End: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React
- Back-End: Express, Node.js, MongoDB
The app is interacting with a REST API that I builded.

## What is the app about?

The application is a social media platform that connects users looking for party mates. Users are able to:
- Sign up, log in, log out
- Browse available events
- Indicate that they will be attending specific events.
- Post publicly and interact with other users through private messaging.
