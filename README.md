# Partymates | Full stack MERN application

![app logo screenshot](/public/images/partymates-logo.PNG)

NB: this repository only shows the FRONT-END part of the project, for the back-end code, please go to: https://github.com/thomasaugot/app-partymates-server

I developed this application as my third and last project during a full stack web development program at Ironhack.
The application uses all MERN stack technologies & is fully responsive, following the mobile first approach:
- Front-End: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React
- Back-End: Express, Node.js, MongoDB
The app is interacting with a REST API that I builded.

## What is the app about?

The application is a social media platform that connects users looking for party mates. Users are able to:
- Sign up, log in, log out
- Browse available events
- Indicate that they will be attending specific events.
- Post publicly and interact with other users through private messaging.

## Instructions to run this app in your computer

If you wish to try and use all of the app features without having to bother signing up, you may use the test account I created for that purpose:
- Username: User Test
- Email: test@test.com
- Password: Test1234!

### Install dependencies

### `npm install`

For the front-end, you will need to add the following environment variable to the .env file:
- REACT_APP_SERVER_URL (example REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5005)

### Run the application

### `npm start`
